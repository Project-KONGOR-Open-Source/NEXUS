However there are those who leave the marsh, sometimes by choice, but most times by force. Bushwack is a hunter that has been living on his own for years. Ostracized from his tribe at a young age for tampering with the technology of an abandoned Dwarven village. Considered to be bad voodoo by the tribal elders, such interactions with the strange machinery was not only forbidden but punishable by exile. Bushwack pleaded with the elders saying that it is foolish to not use the power of one of their greatest foes, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. So he parted ways with his people in order to pursue his passions. Now he is one of the most feared hunters of the southern parts of Death's Cradle, using his troll cunning and dwarven ingenuity, to eliminate foes from great distances. Even though he works alone he is steadfast in the protection of his home and has aligned himself with the Helbourne who are also enemies of the Dwarves. Meeting the Electrician and Dr. Repulsor cemented his belief that the only way for his people to survive in these changing times is through harnessing technology, and leaving the voodoo behind.",

When she finally mustered the courage to forsake her vows and present herself to the king, Jeraziah accused her of being a daemon herself, trying to tempt him into the sin that would cast his soul down to be condemned by The Three Judges of All and forever imprisoned by the dragon guardian Sunder. Devastated, Sister Arete gorged on poison and damned her own soul. This is what she wanted. The Three Judges sent her to face Sunder, who hoards the souls within the Vault of All Hells, where she used her mastery of the dark arts to make the fearsome guardian her pet. Now she has become Calamity, breaking open the doors of hell and unleashing an endless stream of tortured souls upon Newerth. But she cares not about this. She will kill every one of Jeraziah's advisors, soldiers—even his savage sister—until only he is left standing, and then she will stand beside him, ruling the Third Corruption together.",

The powerful ruler of those harsh lands knew her lands would be next and could not sit idly by while her kingdom fell. Thus, the only sorceress deserving of the name Frost Queen fights not to defend the Legion but to bring forth the full might of winter and banish the daemons back to the pit from which they crawled.",

Those left to quiver in the darkness called them gates to Hell. And Hell, from them, emerged.\" Rithe The Geomancer burst through a sacrificial shrine and was the first to taste the flesh of Moon Queen's brood, and he was the last to return to the depths of the underworld when food and souls became scarce and the agony had quelled. For many years he feasted on the blood and pain of those who had been taken during the First Corruption.

Many on Newerth have attempted to commune with this place of power and Valreia The Riftwalker is one of the few who is known to have succeeded. Since the Hellbourne enlisted her help in the war against the Legion, rifts have been opening in various parts of Newerth and a great creature has made its way through. Even in the darkness of the Great Rift, there's terror and this creature known only as Grinex is the embodiment of fear. Trapped in a strange new world, this evil power seeks the Riftwalker, as she represents his only chance to escape from this wretched land. Using the Great Rift's power should not be taken lightly and this mere human has grown arrogant. Her time grows short as Grinex approaches from the shadows!",

Soon, the symbol was complete and, bathed in his own rage-filled blood, a bargain was struck. The warrior's wish would be granted. He would be given the power that he so desired and the opportunity to exact his revenge. The now-cursed warrior was given two hell-forged firearms and was reborn as Gunblade, Hell's Ranger.

To ensure the Hellbourne are driven back into the pits from which they spawned, each will empower an avatar to fight on their behalf, a Prophet to ensure that fate favors the bold. Although the pacts started out as noble, the Prophet did not realize that Raven is a trickster and his pacts come at a cost. The power that the Prophet wielded was more than any one man should taste, and soon he craved more. The only way to achieve such levels of power was the sacrifice of others and when the Legion discovered this wickedness, the Prophet was marked for retribution.

The Mermaid's Wrath and her entire crew were lost to the whirlpool, and as soon as the top castle disappeared the waters returned to serenity. But below the surface, these fine sailors and their captain were just beginning the endless torture of The Maw. Their lungs were filled with its icy waters, which had a terrible, undeniable consciousness, and their bodies were broken, battered, and reformed in the undertow. When the Second Corruption occurred and all of Newerth shook, The Maw released Riptide to serve as a protector of the deep, imbued with additional strength whenever she feels the cold comfort of water, and to deliver the most skilled warriors of Newerth back to the abyss. If the shape-shifting Riptide is any indication of what will become of them, it is best for everyone to stay out of the river.",

Reborn after the Beast Bone Years as Tarot, a fortune teller who travels with her caravan of gypsies through the ravaged Forests Of Caldavar, she foresaw the downfall of Maliken Grimm and the opening of The Scar but was powerless to stop it. Now, Tarot has visions of the destruction of the World Tree, and with full awareness of the doomed future of Newerth she cannot continue with mere divination. She must join the fight against the Hellbourne and tip fate, wavering on the precarious tip of destruction, toward life.",

        "content": "In the northeast reaches of the Rulian Marsh exist a tribe that have fought hard for a place to call their own. However there are those who leave the marsh, sometimes by choice, but most times by force. Bushwack is a hunter that has been living on his own for years. Ostracized from his tribe at a young age for tampering with the technology of an abandoned Dwarven village. Considered to be bad voodoo by the tribal elders, such interactions with the strange machinery was not only forbidden but punishable by exile. Bushwack pleaded with the elders saying that it is foolish to not use the power of one of their greatest foes, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. So he parted ways with his people in order to pursue his passions. Now he is one of the most feared hunters of the southern parts of Death's Cradle, using his troll cunning and dwarven ingenuity, to eliminate foes from great distances. Even though he works alone he is steadfast in the protection of his home and has aligned himself with the Helbourne who are also enemies of the Dwarves. Meeting the Electrician and Dr. Repulsor cemented his belief that the only way for his people to survive in these changing times is through harnessing technology, and leaving the voodoo behind.",

When she finally mustered the courage to forsake her vows and present herself to the king, Jeraziah accused her of being a daemon herself, trying to tempt him into the sin that would cast his soul down to be condemned by The Three Judges of All and forever imprisoned by the dragon guardian Sunder. Devastated, Sister Arete gorged on poison and damned her own soul. This is what she wanted. The Three Judges sent her to face Sunder, who hoards the souls within the Vault of All Hells, where she used her mastery of the dark arts to make the fearsome guardian her pet. Now she has become Calamity, breaking open the doors of hell and unleashing an endless stream of tortured souls upon Newerth. But she cares not about this. She will kill every one of Jeraziah's advisors, soldiers—even his savage sister—until only he is left standing, and then she will stand beside him, ruling the Third Corruption together.",

Those left to quiver in the darkness called them gates to Hell. And Hell, from them, emerged.\" Rithe The Geomancer burst through a sacrificial shrine and was the first to taste the flesh of Moon Queen's brood, and he was the last to return to the depths of the underworld when food and souls became scarce and the agony had quelled. For many years he feasted on the blood and pain of those who had been taken during the First Corruption.

Driven by madness, he began to carve a cursed symbol into his own flesh. Pain was forgotten and only revenge filled his mind. Soon, the symbol was complete and, bathed in his own rage-filled blood, a bargain was struck. The warrior's wish would be granted. He would be given the power that he so desired and the opportunity to exact his revenge. The now-cursed warrior was given two hell-forged firearms and was reborn as Gunblade, Hell's Ranger.

Rather, he was drawn forth from the earth, as evil calls to evil and separate flames join to form an inferno. A holdover from an ancient, cataclysmic age of fire, Magmus dreams of returning Newerth to ash, lava, and cinder, and he wields his considerable might and magic in that terrible cause.",

These are not the infernal pacts of the Deamons, but instead they are made with the forces that oppose the chaos the Hellbourne bring. The creatures of the world and the forces of life, death, and nature themselves all wish to have their say in the fate of Newerth. To ensure the Hellbourne are driven back into the pits from which they spawned, each will empower an avatar to fight on their behalf, a Prophet to ensure that fate favors the bold. Although the pacts started out as noble, the Prophet did not realize that Raven is a trickster and his pacts come at a cost. The power that the Prophet wielded was more than any one man should taste, and soon he craved more. The only way to achieve such levels of power was the sacrifice of others and when the Legion discovered this wickedness, the Prophet was marked for retribution. He escaped to join the ranks of the Hellbourne where his prophecies can be cast without regard for life or morality.",

The Mermaid's Wrath and her entire crew were lost to the whirlpool, and as soon as the top castle disappeared the waters returned to serenity. But below the surface, these fine sailors and their captain were just beginning the endless torture of The Maw. Their lungs were filled with its icy waters, which had a terrible, undeniable consciousness, and their bodies were broken, battered, and reformed in the undertow. When the Second Corruption occurred and all of Newerth shook, The Maw released Riptide to serve as a protector of the deep, imbued with additional strength whenever she feels the cold comfort of water, and to deliver the most skilled warriors of Newerth back to the abyss. If the shape-shifting Riptide is any indication of what will become of them, it is best for everyone to stay out of the river.",

The magicks used were so potent that only a chosen warrior, born in perfect balance between light and darkness, could harness its vast power by being forever bonded to her armor. In the night, the chosen can retake her true form and strike from the shadows, free from her confining shell.
