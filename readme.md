<h3 align="center">Concise Instructions For Developers</h3>

Run In Development

```powershell
# In The Context Of The Solution Directory
dotnet run --project ASPIRE.AppHost --launch-profile "Project KONGOR Development"
```

<br/>

Run In Production

```powershell
# In The Context Of The Solution Directory
dotnet run --project ASPIRE.AppHost --launch-profile "Project KONGOR Production"
```

<br/>

> [!NOTE]
> If no launch profile is specified, then the first profile in `launchSettings.json` will be used.
> Normally, this default profile is a development profile, which allows developers to run the project quickly by executing just `dotnet run` without specifying a launch profile.

<br/>

Create A Database Schema Migration

1. install the Entity Framework Core CLI by executing `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` or update it by executing `dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef`
2. in the context of the solution directory, execute `dotnet ef migrations add {MigrationName} --project MERRICK.Database`

<br/>

Update The Database Schema

```powershell
# Development Database
# In The Context Of The Solution Directory
$ENV:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "Development"
dotnet ef database update --project MERRICK.Database
```

```powershell
# Production Database
# In The Context Of The Solution Directory
$ENV:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "Production"
dotnet ef database update --project MERRICK.Database
```

<br/>

> [!NOTE]
> Updating the database schema manually is only required during development, when there is a potential for database schema migrations to fail.
> If the migrations are stable, then manually updating the database can be skipped, as that happens automatically at runtime.
> This also means that a database will be fully scaffolded at runtime if it does not already exist.

<br/>

Generate .NET Aspire Deployment Artefacts & Deploy To Azure/Kubernetes

> [!NOTE]
> Azure deployments require the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev), and Kubernetes deployments require [Aspir8](https://github.com/prom3theu5/aspirational-manifests).
> The documentation of each tool should be inspected for more complex deployment configurations.

```powershell
# Azure
winget install microsoft.azd

# In The Context Of The ASPIRE.AppHost Project Directory
azd init
azd up
```

```powershell
# Kubernetes
dotnet tool install -g aspirate

# In The Context Of The ASPIRE.AppHost Project Directory
aspirate init
aspirate generate
aspirate apply
```

```powershell
# Manifest
# In The Context Of The Solution Directory
dotnet run --project ASPIRE.AppHost\ASPIRE.AppHost.csproj -- --publisher manifest --output-path manifest.json
```
