<h3 align="center">Concise Instructions For Developers</h3>

Run In Development

```powershell
# In The Context Of The Solution Directory
dotnet run --project ASPIRE.AppHost --launch-profile "Project KONGOR Development"
```

<br/>

Run In Production

```powershell
# In The Context Of The Solution Directory
dotnet run --project ASPIRE.AppHost --launch-profile "Project KONGOR Production"
```

<br/>

> [!NOTE]
> If no launch profile is specified, then the first profile in `launchSettings.json` will be used.
> Normally, this default profile is a development profile, which allows developers to run the project quickly by executing just `dotnet run` without specifying a launch profile.

<br/>

Create A Database Schema Migration

1. install the Entity Framework Core CLI by executing `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` or update it by executing `dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef`
2. in the context of the solution directory, execute `dotnet ef migrations add {MigrationName} --project MERRICK.Database`

<br/>

Update The Database Schema

```powershell
# Development Database
# In The Context Of The Solution Directory
$ENV:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "Development"
dotnet ef database update --project MERRICK.Database
```

```powershell
# Production Database
# In The Context Of The Solution Directory
$ENV:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "Production"
dotnet ef database update --project MERRICK.Database
```

<br/>

> [!NOTE]
> Updating the database schema manually is only required during development, when there is a potential for database schema migrations to fail.
> If the migrations are stable, then manually updating the database can be skipped, as that happens automatically at runtime.
> This also means that a database will be fully scaffolded at runtime if it does not already exist.

<br/>

Generate .NET Aspire Deployment Artefacts & Deploy To Azure/Kubernetes

> [!NOTE]
> Azure deployments require the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev), and Kubernetes deployments require [Aspir8](https://github.com/prom3theu5/aspirational-manifests).
> The documentation of each tool should be inspected for more complex deployment configurations.

```powershell
# Azure
winget install microsoft.azd

# In The Context Of The ASPIRE.AppHost Project Directory
azd init
azd up
```

```powershell
# Kubernetes
dotnet tool install -g aspirate

# In The Context Of The ASPIRE.AppHost Project Directory
aspirate init
aspirate generate
aspirate apply
```

```powershell
# Manifest
# In The Context Of The Solution Directory
dotnet run --project ASPIRE.AppHost\ASPIRE.AppHost.csproj -- --publisher manifest --output-path manifest.json
```

<br/>

Install/Update .NET Aspire

> [!NOTE]
> The Aspire NuGet packages referenced by the respective projects need to be in-sync with the Aspire dotnet workload.

```powershell
# Install
dotnet workload install aspire
```

```powershell
# Update
dotnet workload update
```

```powershell
# Check The Installed Version
dotnet workload list
```

> [!NOTE]
> Mode in-depth information is available here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/setup-tooling.

Debug HTTP Traffic With Fiddler

1. launch Project KONGOR in development mode, by using the `ASPIRE.AppHost Development` profile
2. start the HoN client with the following command line parameters: `-masterserver 127.0.0.1:8888 -webserver 127.0.0.1:8888 -messageserver 127.0.0.1:8888`; to proxy the the HoN server through Fiddler, set the master server to `127.0.0.1:8888` in the COMPEL configuration file
3. in Fiddler, in the bottom-left corner, make sure that the application type filter is set to `All Processes`
4. in Fiddler, click in the bottom-left corner to disable traffic capturing, which removes the noise from implicitly captured traffic; anything explicitly sent to the Fiddler proxy with default port 8888 will still be captured
5. in Fiddler, go to `Rules > Customize Rules`, then `Go > to OnBeforeRequest`, and add `oSession.url = oSession.url.Replace("127.0.0.1:8888", "127.0.0.1:55555");` and `oSession.url = oSession.url.Replace("0.0.0.0:8888", "127.0.0.1:55555");` to forward traffic to the Project KONGOR development server once it's been captured
